# Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree

This repository contains projects completed for the Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree.  Projects include:

## Project 1: Finding Donors for CharityML  

Several supervised algorithms were used to model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm was optimized with hyperparameter tuning. The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.
