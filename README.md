# Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree

This repository contains projects completed for the Udacity Machine Learning Introduction Nanodegree.  Projects include:

## Project 1: Finding Donors for CharityML  

Several supervised algorithms were used to model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm was optimized with hyperparameter tuning. The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. 

Applied:
sklearn GaussianNB, LogisticRegression, and GradientBoostingClassifier models

## Project 2: Image Classifier

Trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.  Developed model in a jupyter notebook.  Built a pytorch neural network model and optimized hyperparameters.  Saved the model as a checkpoint.
Developed a command line program for training on and classifying image files.
Applied:  
pytorch nn
python argparse


## Project 3: Creating Customer Segments with Arvato

Under Construction
